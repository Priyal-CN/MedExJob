# TODO: Make Employer Verification Process Fully Dynamic

## Pending Tasks
- [ ] Update EmployerVerification.tsx to fetch real employer verification status
- [ ] Implement conditional rendering based on verification status (approved -> redirect to subscription, pending -> show upload form, rejected -> show rejection message)
- [ ] Add API call to fetch current employer's verification status on component mount
- [ ] Handle loading states and error handling for API calls
- [ ] Remove mock data and integrate with real employer data from API
- [ ] Test the complete verification flow from upload → admin review → payment redirect
- [ ] Ensure proper navigation using React Router
